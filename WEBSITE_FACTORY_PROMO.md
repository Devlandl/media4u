After seeing too many great local businesses with terrible (or no) websites, I decided to do something about it.

Here's my offer:
→ I'll build you a professional website
→ You see it live before paying
→ $699 if you want it (typical cost: $3-5k)
→ $0 if you don't

No proposals. No meetings. No trust required.
Just a finished website you can see and touch.

Currently accepting 10 businesses.
Comment "interested" or DM me.

### TikTok/Instagram Reel Script
